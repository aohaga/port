            <p1 style="padding: 1em; display: block;">The project folder of this game was called 'ARGOSY'. 'The ARGOSY' is a reference Id been using because of a neon sign in Alton, IL. The builds of this game-demo however, were just named 'test-environment'. </p1>
            <p1 style="padding: 1em; display: block;">A name like that is applicable. I was really attempting to represent an environment or place with this prototype. </p1>

                Eventually I started to feel like the player system in this demo was lack-luster. It had some good ideas that weren't executed as smoothly as they should have been in order to feel polished.
                However, I still feel that there is a lot of success to the level flow. The progam has a physical, solid feeling and at the same time its breaking, dropping data, and falling apart, and in some degree this correctly represents what I had hoped too.

            <p1 style="padding: 1em; display: block;"> As part of the demo there was a dialouge system, with an arrow in the top left that would point players through a series of conversations with the characters.</p1>

                This mish mashed and patchy, glitching place ended up teaching me a lot and led to a lot of exploratory logic and play-testing. Over time, the program became less of a game,
                and more of an environment through which to cut, extract, edit, and play with vision. I started to use the program to push render textures
                and occlusion culls to their breaking points. The unconvential results opened up my approach to placing and linking cameras in following demos.

            <p1>
                While taking 'The Electronic Manuscript' with Judy Mallloy, I began a more stripped back project that would follow test-environment, and be influenced by conversations we were having
                about publishing structures.
                'Go That Way' as the demo was eventually named, was developed for WebGL and published via a web page on a GitHub repo.
                'Go That Way' was imagined in a chapterized format. The menu shows a drop down to select 'chapters'. Considering the build time of about 1 and a half weeks, I only got to 2 'chapters'.

                However, during this time I also started journaling  about the process as I worked. Where I left off, I find a note on
                my notepad that says "if character turns left they turn into a fish.' seems like a good idea.
            </p1>
            <p1>
                A few thing stand out in 'Go That Way' that are also noticeable in different projects and at other times in this portfolio. One is the questioning of how subjective postioning
                functions and is experienced in games. You can see this most in the collage elements and the transition from 'Chapter One' to 'Chapter Two'.
            </p1>

            <p1>
                The second thing worth mentioning is that by about this time in the summer of 2023, I had been (and still am) making games on a mid-powered laptop with a
                motherboard that occasionally shorts. As 'Poem' explores, hardware limitation could also become more and more of a creative element for me. Additionally I accept that
                everything is transitory. Computers and programs are two kinds of structures - one built, and one written - for containing ethereal subject matter. They enable performances, like a theater.

        <div style="margin-top:25px;">
            <p1>
                'Poem' is based on using generative code loops. Both the poetic text, and the game world are created out of pre-existing data
                that is organized during run time for the player to see and read. In the case of the text, the original poem's stanzas were broken into lines, and these lines served
                as a pool for the new stanzas. This idea is in the manner of 'Taroko Gorge'. In the Electronic Manuscript, I learned that 'Taroko Gorge', originally programmed by Nick Montfort is a touchstone and quote, unquote rite of passage for
                authors of hyper-text literature. If you visit https://nickm.com/taroko_gorge/ youll see many different versions of the poem written by a catalouge of notable scripters. Its worth running a few on your device.

                Regarding the environment, 'endlessness' is simulated by a constrained point of view. The camera faces a pink fog, and the environmental details are placed just outside the frustrum
                of the camera. Simultaneously, the players position is not changing, instead, the elements of the environment are moved around them. Since motion is relative, this is fundamentally
                similar to the player moving, even if the animations of the character occasionally feel akward. The animations could definitely could be better.
                All in all the player is only surrounded in a space about a few square units in each direction. Like a lot of my projects, its friendly to
                processing power. I run this demo on android phones with no problem.

            <p1>After ending up with all these different concepts (Argosy, Go That Way, Poem, Fary Game) I started work on a project called 'In An Uan Electrique', which roughly translates to 'In A Lamb Electric'.</p1>
