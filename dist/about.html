    In my practice of game design, I move through experimentation. I've always been an artist first; I try to think of video games and computer
    programming as a form to explore. Over time I've picked up a lot of language skills as I've needed them, but I've always tried
    to be relatively platform agnostic and strong in my theory. Recently, I graduated from the School of the Art
    Institute of Chicago where I studied in their New Media, Experimental 3D, and Art and Technology programs while also painting, drawing, and studying
    music and performance. Through the resources, knowledgeable teachers, and peer feedback of the school I practiced my technical skills inside of a
    conceptual pedagogy that, when it was at its best, emphasized the importance of relationships, adaptability, and consideration.

    This portfolio hopes to take you into my game design process and show you my ongoing work as it gets put together. The portfolio is organized as a catalouge of prototypes. 
    I am very aware that each protoype has rough edges. I will admit this is because game development is difficult.  
    However, some important aspects of this 'rough' quaility are due to my personal approach, which is often exploratory and collage-esque; it never follows a polished formula, there is no start or end. 
    It is my hope that through this portfolio I can show some different answers
    to different problems, and even different answers to the same problem. We will start with a demo that I call "The Fary Game" or "Playing with Boundary".
